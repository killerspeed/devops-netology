An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # yandex_compute_image.ubu-img will be created
  + resource "yandex_compute_image" "ubu-img" {
      + created_at      = (known after apply)
      + folder_id       = (known after apply)
      + id              = (known after apply)
      + min_disk_size   = (known after apply)
      + name            = "ubuntu-20-04"
      + os_type         = (known after apply)
      + pooled          = (known after apply)
      + product_ids     = (known after apply)
      + size            = (known after apply)
      + source_disk     = (known after apply)
      + source_family   = (known after apply)
      + source_image    = "fd8uj3pr8jv6nhmkutag"
      + source_snapshot = (known after apply)
      + source_url      = (known after apply)
      + status          = (known after apply)
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: You didn't specify an "-out" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform
can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if
"terraform apply" is subsequently run
